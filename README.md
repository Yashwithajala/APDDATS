# Automated Plant Disease Detection and Treatment System

This project aims to help farmers and plant enthusiasts detect plant diseases using image classification and suggest possible treatments. The system uses a trained deep learning model (.h5) to identify diseases in plant leaf images and displays the results via a web-based frontend.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload plant leaf images to get predictions
- Identify 8 types of conditions (including healthy)
- Diagnosis and treatment suggestions for each disease
- Clean and simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend interface
- Flask backend to handle prediction requests using the `.h5` model

---

## ðŸ§  Model Info

The trained model detects the following plant conditions:
- Anthracnose
- Bacterial Canker
- Cutting Weevil
- Die Back
- Gall Midge
- Powdery Mildew
- Sooty Mould
- Healthy

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used

- Python (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pillow,OpenCV)
- Flask
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)
- Google Colab (for training)
- VS Code
